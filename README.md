Linked List is a project that focuses on creating a program that allows users to hold onto website information, remember if they read the website or not, and then delete when he or she is ready. The user will not be able to submit their website until all necessary information has been inserted into the provided input fields. This was the first paired project that we were assigned to for class. We initially split it up and had everything organized so that we could execute this together. We worked on the html and css together at first, then split up some of the javascript. See below in the DTR for more details.
